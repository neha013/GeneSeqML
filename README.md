# GeneSeqML
Empowering Gene Function Prediction through DNA Sequencing and Machine Learning
Certainly! Here are some introductory lines you can use to provide an overview of the project, dataset, and results in a tabular format:

**Project Overview:**
An intelligent classification model that harnesses the potential of DNA sequencing and machine learning to predict gene function, enabling precise annotations and deeper understanding of genetic information

**Dataset:**
The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nageshsingh/dna-sequence-dataset) used in this project comprises DNA sequence coding regions along with corresponding class labels for human, chimpanzee, and dog. It provides a valuable resource for investigating gene function prediction across species. The dataset includes genetic information specifically from coding regions, which are crucial for understanding gene expression and functional characteristics. By incorporating data from multiple species, including the closely related chimpanzee and the more divergent dog, the dataset allows for comparative genomics analysis and insights into evolutionary patterns.

**Results:**

The project has generated positive outcomes, as demonstrated in the table presented. Our evaluation of the model's performance and effectiveness involved assessing it using diverse metrics.

| Dataset | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 score|
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Human | 0.984 | 0.984 | 0.984 | 0.984 |
| Chimpanzee | 0.914 | 0.927 | 0.914 | 0.914 |
| Dog | 0.689 | 0.781 | 0.673 | 0.689 |
